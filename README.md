📋 Project Overview

This project is part of the Java Developer Internship program.
The goal is to create a Java Console-Based Quiz Application that tests the user's basic Java knowledge.
It demonstrates your ability to use control flow, loops, collections, and object-oriented programming.

🎯 Objective

To build an interactive quiz program using:

Lists to store questions and options

Loops and conditional logic for evaluating answers

Basic I/O for user interaction

🧩 Features

✅ Displays multiple-choice questions
✅ Accepts user input for each question
✅ Validates answers and gives instant feedback
✅ Calculates and displays the final score
✅ Uses List, ArrayList, and object-oriented concepts

💻 Technologies Used

Language: Java

JDK Version: 8 or above

IDE (Optional): IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code

📂 Project Structure

QuizApp/
├── QuizApp.java        # Main program file
├── README.md           # Project documentation

🧠 How It Works

1. The Question class stores the question text, options, and correct answer index.
2. A List<Question> is used to hold multiple questions.
3. The program displays each question and prompts the user to input their answer.
4. It checks correctness, updates the score, and displays feedback.
5. At the end, the final score is shown with a performance message.


🚀 How to Run the Program

Option 1: Using Command Line

1. Open terminal in the project folder.


2. Compile the file:

javac QuizApp.java


3. Run the program:

java QuizApp



Option 2: Using an IDE

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

2. Run the QuizApp class directly.


🧾 Sample Output

Question 1: Which keyword is used to inherit a class in Java?
1. super
2. extends
3. implements
4. inherits
Enter your answer (1-4): 2
✅ Correct!

🎯 Your final score: 3/4
Good job! 👍


🧠 Learning Outcome

Implemented control flow and logic in Java

Used collections to manage data efficiently

Practiced OOP principles with custom classes

Gained experience with user input and basic validation


🏁 Future Enhancements

Add quiz categories (Java, OOP, Data Structures)

Include timer for each question

Save user scores to a file

Build a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing
